### Last assesment

hi peeps! First and foremost: try to finish the Back-end exercise.
It could become handy in future challenges! Please consult each other, and the internet when you are stuck.
However! Don't spend too much time with finetuning this back-end app..
Project weeks are here! Please consult our Drive to see which options there are for the final project: developing a game. presentation date: 13/11/2022
You have two weeks, so try to have a mvp next week.
Fcfs will apply for the games, so when you have decided with your team mate, please post your preference in our slack channel.
And yes, check out who has the same color as you, because that will be your project partner.
