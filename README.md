## Assessment 2: Caesar’s cipher

The application has the following requirements:
Text from the textarea is encrypted and rendered for the user
Encryption happens when the “shift” value is set
Encryption of the text is updated which each new character typed by the user given there is a value set for “shift”
Application has an appealing design and provides a great user experience.
